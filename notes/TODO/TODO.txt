In the middle of:
- Created obj_bonus_drop, need to create logic to spawn it, make it "targetable", and test


------------------------------------------------------------
BEFORE ALPHA RELEASE:
------------------------------------------------------------

"Bugs" and things to fix:
- Need Collateral and Assist Icon + title/description
- Tutorial overlay overlapping your strike and strike level
   - Make it so it only shows text in the center when you hover on an element
- Game Over not destroying all instances
   - obj_ultimates stay visible
- "Play again" option breaks
   - Some variables not properly reset
- Improve enemy spawning logic by using some hidden notion of a "enemy value" bar
   - This would store the number of enemy assets allowed in existence at once time
     For example, level 1 might have a asset value of 50, level 10 might be like 500
	 Each enemy that spawns has a certain value (enemy_1 = 10?, enemy_4 = 100?)
	 The bar gradually increases over time and decreases when an enemy is spawned.
	 Thus the likelihood to get bigger enemies goes up with time
	 - Possibly downsides are that you may only ever get smaller enemies?


Testing settings that need reverting:
- main_menu create script skips the menu and selects defaults
- game_controller starting on level 7

Polish & effects:
- Add glitter effect to background
- Sounds effects!
  - Shoot
  - Explode
  - Round ending crescendo
- Thought of a cool effect to stylize the innermost circle (the one around your ship) with some kind of animated border
  Maybe something like Audio Equalizer bars pointing in 360 around the circle, jumping up slightly when an enemy is close
  Or if you fire in that direction? ... Need to give it more thought.
- Create indicator on the side showing what ults are active (instead of the circle around the player)
- On collateral, subtly show an enemy is in range before you shoot
  - Maybe there's a thing line connecting them?

Gameplay:
- Spawn the perk orbs randomly after kills
    - The likelihood of them spawning should flex with how despearate you are
- Boss levels
    - Coreographed compound enemies
	- Maybe showcasing the "sequence" logic somehow?
- Main Menu
	- Logo,
	- Wave select
	- Save settings to ini

BEFORE FINAL RELEASE:	
------------------------------------------------------------


Multiplayer:
    - CHECK THE obj_network_controller Create event for TODOs - that's the most recent stuff you were working on
	- I think any call to instance_create_layer should trigger a new INSTANCE_CREATED event. 
	    - This is how enemy spawn events currently work so that could be refactored out.
	- obj_player needs to determine whose streak color to use when drawing its barrel and muzzle flash
	    - Need to pass the player who shot's ID around. I started this process, but need to follow through
	- Need to finalize the Join / Host UX so lobby can be created
	- just about ready to start testing I guess? Need to run gamemaker (and steam under a 2nd account) on a 2nd comp


Premium:
- A DLC that unlocks:
  - Hosting CoOp (can join one with free version)
  - 3 of the 6 ultimates

Pie In The Sky:
- A Multiplayer-only enemy that shows its equation only to one player. 
	- Maybe the enemy appears as your teammate's color indiating you can't hit it?
- "Practice" mode for:
    - Main game (a modified enemy_1 that just travels right towards you, one at a time - next one as soon as you kill one, no power ups, just guessing answers)
	- Math ult puzzle
- Pre-determine all enemies in a round and show them at the start as a sequence. Maybe you see them the whole time and slowly X your way through them??
- Sound effects
