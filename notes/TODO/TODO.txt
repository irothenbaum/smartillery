CHECK THE obj_network_controller Create event for TODOs - that's the most recent stuff you were working on

- Multiplayer
    - Create "guest" game controller to parody host actions received in network_controller
	- Need to update enemies (and explosions, etc) to be creatable using meta data 
- Remove Heal and Slow ult. Implement a new Lightning ult that destroys nearby enemies
- "Practice" mode for:
    - Main game (a modified enemy_1 that just travels right towards you, one at a time - next one as soon as you kill one, no power ups, just guessing answers)
	- Math ult puzzle
- Pre-determine all enemies in a round and show them at the start as a sequence. Maybe you see them the whole time and slowly X your way through them??
- Sound effects
- Main Menu
	- Logo,
	- Wave select
