BEFORE FINAL RELEASE:	
------------------------------------------------------------


Multiplayer:
    - CHECK THE obj_network_controller Create event for TODOs - that's the most recent stuff you were working on
	- I think any call to instance_create_layer should trigger a new INSTANCE_CREATED event. 
	    - This is how enemy spawn events currently work so that could be refactored out.
	- obj_player needs to determine whose streak color to use when drawing its barrel and muzzle flash
	    - Need to pass the player who shot's ID around. I started this process, but need to follow through
	- Need to finalize the Join / Host UX so lobby can be created
	- just about ready to start testing I guess? Need to run gamemaker (and steam under a 2nd account) on a 2nd comp


Premium:
- A DLC that unlocks:
  - Hosting CoOp (can join one with free version)
  - 3 of the 6 ultimates

Pie In The Sky:
- A Multiplayer-only enemy that shows its equation only to one player. 
	- Maybe the enemy appears as your teammate's color indiating you can't hit it?
- "Practice" mode for:
    - Main game (a modified enemy_1 that just travels right towards you, one at a time - next one as soon as you kill one, no power ups, just guessing answers)
	- Math ult puzzle
- Pre-determine all enemies in a round and show them at the start as a sequence. Maybe you see them the whole time and slowly X your way through them??
- Sound effects
