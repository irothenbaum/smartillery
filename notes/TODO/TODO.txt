CHECK THE obj_network_controller Create event for TODOs - that's the most recent stuff you were working on

Polish & effects:
- Add glitter effect to background
- When the point orbs hit the turret there should be feedback (like the turret gets brighter maybe?)
- Should show an effect while the enemies with multiple HP wait for a new equation
  - Maybe numbers cycling quickly, or visually scrambled
  - Should also show the new equation sooner. Give the player a chance to kill it before it starts moving agian?


Multiplayer:
	- I think any call to instance_create_layer should trigger a new INSTANCE_CREATED event. 
	    - This is how enemy spawn events currently work so that could be refactored out.
	- obj_player needs to determine whose streak color to use when drawing its barrel and muzzle flash
	    - Need to pass the player who shot's ID around. I started this process, but need to follow through
	- Need to finalize the Join / Host UX so lobby can be created
	- just about ready to start testing I guess? Need to run gamemaker (and steam under a 2nd account) on a 2nd comp


Gameplay:
- Implement Collateral ult that destroys nearby enemies
- Implement "Aim assist" ult that rounds your answer up/down to match
- Implement simplify ult that makes the enemis equations way easier
  - I don't like this one, but I think I do want 6 ults... Think of a new one!?
- Adjust the end-of-round heal logic
  - Instead, if you start a round with < 50 health, half way through that round it will spawn a health bomb which is an equation you can solve to regain health up to 50
     - Maybe it's like, it shows an equation, you solve it, get 1 bar of health. Can repeat until your health = 50
	 - Or maybe it always spawns if your health < 100 and you can get up to 3 hits on it (+3 bars of hp)?
- The combo indicator should be more subtle and appear over your input bar (so each player can track their own)
- Main Menu
	- Logo,
	- Wave select
	- Save settings to ini
- steam leaderboard integration

Premium:
- A DLC that unlocks:
  - Hosting CoOp (can join one with free version)
  - 3 of the 6 ultimates

Pie In The Sky:
- A Multiplayer-only enemy that shows its equation only to one player. 
	- Maybe the enemy appears as your teammate's color indiating you can't hit it?
- "Practice" mode for:
    - Main game (a modified enemy_1 that just travels right towards you, one at a time - next one as soon as you kill one, no power ups, just guessing answers)
	- Math ult puzzle
- Pre-determine all enemies in a round and show them at the start as a sequence. Maybe you see them the whole time and slowly X your way through them??
- Sound effects
