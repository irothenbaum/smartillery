CHECK THE obj_network_controller Create event for TODOs - that's the most recent stuff you were working on


- Add glitter effect to background
- Multiplayer
    - Create "guest" game controller to parody host actions received in network_controller
	- I think any call to instance_create_layer should trigger a new INSTANCE_CREATED event. 
	     - This is how enemy spawn events currently work so that could be refactored out.
	- obj_player needs to determine whose streak color to use when drawing its barrel and muzzle flash
	- Need to finalize the Join / Host UX so lobby can be created
	- just about ready to start testing I guess? Need to run gamemaker (and steam under a 2nd account) on a 2nd comp
- A Multiplayer-only enemy that shows its equation only to one player. 
	- Maybe the enemy appears as your teammate's color indiating you can't hit it?
- Remove Heal and Slow ult. Implement a new Lightning ult that destroys nearby enemies
- "Practice" mode for:
    - Main game (a modified enemy_1 that just travels right towards you, one at a time - next one as soon as you kill one, no power ups, just guessing answers)
	- Math ult puzzle
- Pre-determine all enemies in a round and show them at the start as a sequence. Maybe you see them the whole time and slowly X your way through them??
- Sound effects
- Main Menu
	- Logo,
	- Wave select
	- Power color selection
	- Save settings to ini
- steam leaderboard integration
