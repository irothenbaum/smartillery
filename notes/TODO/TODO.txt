In the middle of:
- Created obj_bonus_drop, need to create logic to spawn it, make it "targetable", and test

------------------------------------------------------------
BEFORE ALPHA RELEASE:
------------------------------------------------------------

"Bugs" and things to fix:
- Tutorial overlay overlapping your strike and strike level
   - Make it so it only shows text in the center when you hover on an element
- Game Over not destroying all instances
   - for example obj_ultimates stay visible
   - Can possibly get by by destroying everything in certain layers? IDK...
- "Play again" option breaks
   - Some variables not properly reset
- When an enemy collides with you the input box shrinks vertically to 0???


Polish & effects:
- Add glitter effect to background
- Sounds effects!
  - Shoot
  - Explode
  - Round ending crescendo
- Thought of a cool effect to stylize the innermost circle (the one around your ship) with some kind of animated border
  Maybe something like Audio Equalizer bars pointing in 360 around the circle, jumping up slightly when an enemy is close
  Or if you fire in that direction? ... Need to give it more thought.
- Create indicator on the side showing what ults are active (instead of the circle around the player)?

Gameplay:
- Spawn the perk orbs randomly after kills
    - The likelihood of them spawning should flex with how despearate you are
- Boss levels
    - Coreographed compound enemies
	- Maybe showcasing the "sequence" logic somehow?
	- I'm thinking it could just be a level with only 1 enemy type (the new enemy introduced at that level 5, 10, 15, etc)
	  - They would just be a series of coreographed waves
- Main Menu
	- Logo,
	- Wave select
	- Save settings to ini
- Ultimate nerf/boost tweaks
   - Aim Assist gets way too powerful at higher levels
      - Maybe cap the number it can retarget so it doesn't just clear the screen after level 10
   - Turret is way to weak
      - Maybe double the # of turrets (level 1: 2 turrets, level 5: 10 turrets)
	  - Would also be cool to increase the number of turrets per orbital at higher orbitals

BEFORE FINAL RELEASE:	
------------------------------------------------------------


Multiplayer:
    - CHECK THE obj_network_controller Create event for TODOs - that's the most recent stuff you were working on
	- I think any call to instance_create_layer should trigger a new INSTANCE_CREATED event. 
	    - This is how enemy spawn events currently work so that could be refactored out.
	- obj_player needs to determine whose streak color to use when drawing its barrel and muzzle flash
	    - Need to pass the player who shot's ID around. I started this process, but need to follow through
	- Need to finalize the Join / Host UX so lobby can be created
	- just about ready to start testing I guess? Need to run gamemaker (and steam under a 2nd account) on a 2nd comp


Premium:
- A DLC that unlocks:
  - Hosting CoOp (can join one with free version)
  - 3 of the 6 ultimates

Pie In The Sky:
- A Multiplayer-only enemy that shows its equation only to one player. 
	- Maybe the enemy appears as your teammate's color indiating you can't hit it?
- "Practice" mode for:
    - Main game (a modified enemy_1 that just travels right towards you, one at a time - next one as soon as you kill one, no power ups, just guessing answers)
	- Math ult puzzle
- Pre-determine all enemies in a round and show them at the start as a sequence. Maybe you see them the whole time and slowly X your way through them??
- Sound effects
